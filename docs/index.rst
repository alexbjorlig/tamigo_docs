   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Tamigo documentation!
==============================================

.. danger:: This is not `official <http://www.tamigo.dk/andet/api-dokumentation/>`_ documentation, but community driven work in progress for offering better api documentation.

This documentation is build using github and read the docs to help `Tamigo <http://tamigo.com>`_ offer better documentation for developers.

* `Github repo <https://github.com/dauledk/tamigo_docs>`_
* `Read The Docs <https://readthedocs.org/>`_ 

I propose Tamigo could utilize Read the Docs to document their entire webpage. From their own web-page: 

We help our customers maximise revenue and minimise wage costs by effective staff management with a market leading app.
