# Tamigo API Documentation
Improved documentation for tamigo webservices!

This documentation is build using github and read the docs to help `Tamigo <http://tamigo.com>`_ offer better documentation for developers.
`Read The Docs <tamigo-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ 

I propose Tamigo could utilize Read the Docs to document their entire webpage. From their own web-page: 

We help our customers maximise revenue and minimise wage costs by effective staff management with a market leading app.
